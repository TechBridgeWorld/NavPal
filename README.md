NavPal Project for TechBridgeWorld

The project folder SpeechToTextRoomSpecifier contains a prototype of a Speech to Text Recognition app that is used by the path planner in order to allow a visually impaired person to specify his or her source and destination location verbally. This app is called SpeechRecognitionExample. There is another app called AndroidTestActivity, which is used to test this SpeechRecognitionExample.
